# vanet
A Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) is a self-managed network for vehicles whose main motive is to improve the safety of drivers and passengers. Intercommunication within the network helps to pass safety and traffic-related information among the vehicles. This project idea tends to generalize the concept of VANET for regular transportation by simply integrating the users’ smartphones in the process. Also, this idea is extended to provide dedicated security services to users who consults for it, especially the transportation sector which already used dedicated VANET in the operation. The idea is to generate the BSM data via every user’s smartphone that uses GPS for navigation and by implementing AI algorithms improvising the safety and security of users. Also, try to detect cyberattacks within the networks to avoid false impressions and detect the attacker.

The mentioned project is the combination of different AI-based features
The attached lanechange.py file detects the chance of accident based on the data (speed, relative speed wrt vehicle ahead, speed of the vehicle approaching from the opposite lane, age of the driver highlighting the judgment calls). This represents a prototype of a single cluster. Cloud based functionality is yet to be appended.
